# PyCube
I made a rubiks cube implementation in Python from scratch using 3D Lists and OOP.


### Prerequisite
Make sure that you have colorama installed using

`pip install colorama`

### How to use

```py
PyCube.displayCube() - shows cube
PyCube.runAlgo(algo, splitter=' ') - run rubik's cube algorithms
PyCube.showMoves() - shows all possible algorithm to use
```
